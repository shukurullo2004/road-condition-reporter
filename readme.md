## 🛣️ Project: Road Condition Reporter System

### 📄 Project Overview
The **Road Condition Reporter System** is an IoT-based application aimed at monitoring and reporting real-time road conditions. Using a 📷 camera and a Raspberry Pi, our system will be capable of detecting road surface irregularities, such as potholes, cracks, and other hazards. This data can help inform 🚗 drivers and relevant authorities, enhancing road safety and enabling timely maintenance.

### 🌟 Key Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** 🕒 Continuous road condition detection using a camera mounted on the Raspberry Pi.
- **Automated Alerts:** 📢 Detect and report irregularities to a centralized server or application.
- **Data Collection:** 📊 Collect and store road data for further analysis to help improve infrastructure.

### 💻 Technology Stack
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 🖥️, Camera Module 📷
- **Software:** Python 🐍 (OpenCV for image processing), IoT communication protocols 🌐
- **Other:** Cloud storage ☁️ for data aggregation, real-time analysis for instant feedback 📈
